Creating a game like Flappy Bird in Unity involves several steps. Below is a technical document outlining the process:

1. Setting up the Project:
Create a new Unity project.
Set up the scene with a 2D background and a ground/platform for the bird to fly over. You can use Unity's built-in 2D tools or create your own assets.

2. Player Control:
Create a player GameObject for the bird.
Implement bird control using Unity's input system. Flapping typically involves tapping the screen or pressing a button to make the bird fly upward.
Apply gravity to the bird to simulate falling when not flapping.

3. Obstacles:
Create obstacle GameObjects, such as pipes or columns, for the bird to navigate through.
Generate obstacles dynamically or place them manually in the scene.
Ensure obstacles are randomly positioned vertically and have gaps for the bird to pass through.

4. Scoring:
Implement a scoring system to keep track of the player's progress.
Award points whenever the bird successfully passes through a gap between obstacles.

5. Collision Detection:
Implement collision detection between the bird and obstacles.
End the game if the bird collides with an obstacle or the ground.
Display a game over screen with the final score when the game ends.

6. Audio and Visual Effects:
Add sound effects for flapping, scoring, and collision.
Implement visual effects, such as animations for the bird's flapping motion and obstacle movement.

7. UI:
Create a user interface to display the current score and any other relevant game information.
Design UI elements for the main menu, game over screen, and pause menu.

8. Background and Parallax Scrolling:
Implement parallax scrolling for the background to create a sense of depth and movement.
Add additional layers with different scrolling speeds to enhance the effect.

9. Testing and Optimization:
Test the game thoroughly to ensure smooth gameplay and correct behavior.
Optimize the game for performance, especially if targeting mobile or low-end devices.

10. Polishing and Additional Features:
Add polish to the game by refining visuals, adjusting difficulty levels, and improving UI elements.
Consider adding additional features, such as power-ups, different obstacle types, or alternate game modes, to enhance replay value.

11. Publishing:
Once the game is complete and tested, build it for your target platforms.
Distribute the game through app stores or online platforms if desired.

Throughout the development process, refer to online tutorials, documentation, and resources to overcome challenges and learn new techniques. 
Additionally, seek feedback from playtesters and other developers to improve the game further. Have fun creating your version of Flappy Bird!
